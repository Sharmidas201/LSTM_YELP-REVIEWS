        "This code snippet implements hyperparameter tuning using k-fold cross-validation for a neural network model, particularly an LSTM-based one. It explores various combinations of learning rates, weight decays, and dropout probabilities to find the optimal configuration. During each iteration, it trains the model on different folds of the training data and evaluates performance on the validation set. It employs techniques like early stopping and learning rate adjustment based on validation loss to prevent overfitting and improve convergence. Finally, it reports the best hyperparameters and the corresponding validation accuracy achieved. In this run, **the best configuration consists of a learning rate of 0.001, weight decay of 1e-06, and a dropout probability of 0.3, achieving a validation accuracy of 84.53%.**"
